##### <u>Norms and Specialization in Household Production: Evidence from a Danish Parental Leave Reform</u>

*The arrival of children implies a sharp reduction in mothers’ earnings and labor supply while fathers’ labor market trajectories are unaffected. To understand this specialization, I exploit a Danish parental leave reform. Upon reform implementation,
mothers increase their leave by 5 weeks while the average leave duration of fathers remains unchanged, irrespectively of relative earnings. Consistent with the role of gender identity, women who had a working mother take a shorter leave than those with a stayat-home mother. Moreover, I document peer effects among sisters who take a longer
leave if exposed to the reform-induced change in leave duration.*

##### <u>Intergenerational Transmission of Gender Segregation</u> 
*Many western economies have seen a fall in the employment share of the traditionally male-dominated, manufacturing sector, while demand is increasing in female-dominated jobs. 
Still, men appear reluctant to enter these occupations. To understand persistent labor market segregation, I exploit within-school-across-cohort variation in the gender composition
of the occupations of schoolmates' parents, and document that gender segregation is transmitted from one generation to the next. Boys who were exposed to gender-stereotypical 
male role models enter male-dominated occupations, while those socialized in cohorts with peers whose fathers worked alongside women enter occupations with more women. This effect 
goes beyond the influence of their father. In general, mothers' labor market behavior has negligible effects on boys. In contrast, girls are mainly influenced by female role models, 
and compared to boys the effects are much smaller. However, when a larger share of mothers works full-time, gender segregation decreases in the next generation.*
