#### <u>Norms and Specialization in Household Production: Evidence from a Danish Parental Leave Reform</u>
*This paper shows that decisions regarding intra-household specializations are determined by
gender norms rather than standard economic incentives. To test theoretical predictions of
both the standard model of intra-household division of labor and the role of gender identity,
social category and prescriptions, I use variation from a Danish parental leave reform. I
find large and homogeneous effects among mothers and virtually unchanged behavior among
fathers, irrespective of relative earnings in the household. This is consistent with the notion
of pay-off from gender identity. Subsequent peer effects among sisters are interpreted as
reform-induced change in prescriptions regarding extensive leave for mothers*
