##### <u>Norms and Specialization in Household Production: Evidence from a Danish Parental Leave Reform</u>

*The arrival of children implies a sharp reduction in mothers’ earnings and labor supply while fathers’ labor market trajectories are unaffected. To understand this specialization, I exploit a Danish parental leave reform. Upon reform implementation,
mothers increase their leave by 5 weeks while the average leave duration of fathers remains unchanged, irrespectively of relative earnings. Consistent with the role of gender identity, women who had a working mother take a shorter leave than those with a stayat-home mother. Moreover, I document peer effects among sisters who take a longer
leave if exposed to the reform-induced change in leave duration.*

##### <u>Gender Gaps from Labor Market Shocks</u>
with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/riaivandic/home"> Ria Ivandic</a> <br>
*Job loss leads to persistent adverse labor market outcomes, but assessments of gender differences in labor market recovery are lacking. We utilize plant closures in Denmark to estimate
gender gaps in labor market outcomes and document that women face an increased risk of unemployment in the two years following job displacement. We decompose the gender gap and
show that human capital explains half of women’s increased risk of unemployment. In addition, childcare imposes an important barrier for women’s labor market recovery regardless of
individual characteristics. Gender differences in sorting across occupations and sectors prior to displacement play a very minor role.*
