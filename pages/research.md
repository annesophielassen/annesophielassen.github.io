##### <u>Norms and Specialization in Household Production: Evidence from a Danish Parental Leave Reform</u>

*This paper shows that decisions regarding intra-household specializations are determined by gender norms rather than standard economic incentives. To test theoretical predictions of both the standard model of intra-household time allocation and the role of gender identity, 
social category and prescriptions, I use variation <br>
from a Danish parental leave reform. 
I find large effects among mothers and virtually unchanged behavior <br>
among fathers, irrespective of relative earnings in the household. This is consistent with the notion of pay-off from gender
identity. Subsequently, I find peer effects among sisters and interpret this as reform-induced prescriptions regarding extensive leave for mothers.*

##### <u>Gender Gaps from Labor Market Shocks</u>

*While a large literature has established that job loss leads to persistent adverse labor market outcomes, assessments of gender differences in labor market recovery are scarce. We utilize plant closures in Denmark to address gender gaps in labor market outcomes following
job displacement and document that women face an increased risk of unemployment. Gender gaps are the largest among disadvantaged groups and when children are present in the household. We compare the relative importance of human capital and childcare responsibility and show that children impose a barrier for women's labor market recovery regardless of individual characteristics. Selection into different firms and occupations across genders plays a very minor role.*
