#### Working Papers
##### <u>Gender Norms and Specialization in Household Production: Evidence from a Danish Parental Leave Reform</u>
*Parental leave is viewed as crucial to alleviating the gender inequalities that arise upon parenthood, but policies are often ineffective. This paper examines the impact of expanding parental leave in Denmark. The results show that mothers increase their
leave by 5 weeks, while the average leave duration of fathers remains unchanged. In turn, the earnings gap within couples increases. Leave duration is unaffected by relative earnings, and is instead highly consistent with the role of gender norms. 
I document both inter-generational spillovers from maternal labor supply and peer effects among sisters who take a longer leave if exposed to the reform-induced change in leave duration.*<br>
