#### Working Papers
##### <u>Norms and Specialization in Household Production: Evidence from a Danish Parental Leave Reform</u>

*This paper shows that decisions regarding intra-household specializations are determined by gender norms rather than standard economic incentives. To test theoretical predictions of both the standard model of intra-household time allocation and the role of gender identity, 
social category and prescriptions, I use variation <br>
from a Danish parental leave reform. 
I find large effects among mothers and virtually unchanged behavior <br>
among fathers, irrespective of relative earnings in the household. This is consistent with the notion of pay-off from gender
identity. Subsequently, I find peer effects among sisters and interpret this as reform-induced prescriptions regarding extensive leave for mothers.*
