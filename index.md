I am a PostDoctoral Researcher at the <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-economics/">Department of Economics</a> at <a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/">Copenhagen Business School</a> where I completed my Ph.D. in economics in November 2022.<br/>
<br>
In the Fall term of 2023, I will be visiting NYU's Department of Economics, hosted by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/raquelfernandezsite/home">Raquel Fern√°ndez</a>. <br/><br>
My research is primarily concerned with the mechanisms behind and implications of gender differences in labor market choices. 
This means my work is placed within the intersection of labor, household, gender and public economics. <br/>
<br>
On this website  you can read about my <a href="https://annesophielassen.github.io/pages/research.html"> research</a>, and <a href="https://annesophielassen.github.io/pages/dissemination.html"> teaching,</a> and find my <a href="https://annesophielassen.github.io/assets/CV.pdf"> CV</a>. 
<br>
I work hard to <a href="https://annesophielassen.github.io/pages/dissemination.html">disseminate</a> my research findings and general knowledge on gender inequality to the attention of a wider audience. For example, I've written columns in <a href="https://www.information.dk/anne-sophie-lassen"> Information</a> and appeared on Danish radio <a href="https://www.dr.dk/lyd/p1/orientering/orientering-2022-08-02"> P1 Orientering</a> as an expert on parental leave.
