I am a PhD Fellow at <p><a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/research/departments-and-centres/department-of-economics/">Department of Economics</a></p> at <p><a href="https://www.cbs.dk/en/">Copenhagen Business School</a></p>. 

My research is primarily concerned with gender inequality, incl. gender differences in labor market choices and implications of this.
This means my work is placed within the intersection of labour, family economics and 
public economics. 

Before starting my PhD studies, I was a RA for Tom Kirchmaier and Niels Westergaard-Nielsen. 
I hold a MSc 
and BSc in Economics (cand.polit) from University of Copenhagen.
